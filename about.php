	<h1>About the Ornaments</h1>

	<p>
		All my ornaments are handmade, by me, in a smoke free home. Each ornament is approx. 3" in diameter. My ornaments start with a 3" styrofoam ball, covered with precisely folded cotton fabric, attached using small sequin pins. To make my ornaments unique, the center of each ornament has a cross stitch design that is related to the theme of the fabric. The ornament is finished with a hand sewn grosgrain or satin bow secured with a matching button.

		If you cannot find a particular themed ornament you are interested in or you have a request for a personalized ornament, please <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>. Some of my best designs were created from customer's suggestions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-style:italic">
		We recommend keeping these ornaments safe from small children and pets as each contains small sequin pins. My ornaments are for decoration only and NOT intended for children or pets.
